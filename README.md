# anyDAO Cross-Chain Governance Frontend
anyDAO is a cross-chain governance protocoll that makes cross-chain voting and governance possible. 

# Problem
Multi-chain projects face many challenges in governance. If there is no cross-chain governance, the protocolls have to options: 
- They may either hold the governance on a single chain and require all the governance toke holders to move their tokens to the governance chain
- They have independet governance on each chain. This may result in communities deciding differently on proposals and have the protocolls on the chains drift apart.

# Infrastructure
To enable cross-chain communication we used [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/). Some of the functionality is mocked.
